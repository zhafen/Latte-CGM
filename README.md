# Time-Fly

This shows the locations of 1e5 particles in the CGM of a Milky-Way progenitor at z=0.25. The specific simulation is a zoom-in galaxy formation simulation (named [Latte](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05957)) created as part of the [FIRE project](https://fire.northwestern.edu).

There are four origins for material in the CGM at z=0.25, and the particles are colored according to their origin:

1. IGM Accretion (blue) - material that has either never been inside a galaxy or inside a galaxy a short time.
2. Wind (green) - material that was in the central galaxy previously
3. Satellite ISM (red) - material that is in a galaxy other than the central galaxy at z=0.25.
4. Satellite Wind (orange) - material that is no longer in a satellite galaxy, but was previously.

Further details can be found in Hafen et al., in prep.

All distances are in proper kpc relative to the central galaxy, and a ruler (100 kpc on a side with 1 kpc spacing between points) is shown in white. The CGM is defined in this case as 0.1-1 times the virial radius. The position of stars at z=0.25 are shown in yellow. Clicking on the downward arrow next to a classification allows one to filter the data according to a variety of options.
